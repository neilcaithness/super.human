# FFS Science Challenge

The analysis programme will convert the scores into graphs that can be shown in the browser or in power point.

## Discuss the graphs
Do these demonstrate a significant improvement between the pre- and post- practice scores for both tasks? Or for one and not the other? Or for neither? Did the control groups also improve? Are these results what you predicted?

If you have demonstrated a significant improvement for both tasks, then you have supported your hypothesis. If not, that does not mean that the hypothesis is false, just that on this particular day, with this particular group of people, and these particular tests, you did not have significant support for it. If so, what could you do next?

## Final point
How have we also used computer technology to enhance human performance?
